                <p>
                    Hello, I'm Pawan Kumar Gupta, a passionate technology enthusiast currently pursuing my 3rd year in B.Tech. 
                    My interests lie in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Full Stack Development. I thrive on solving 
                    complex problems and have honed my skills in string manipulation, data analysis, and algorithm design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My journey in technology started early, driven by curiosity and a love for learning. Over the years, I've 
                    acquired proficiency in multiple programming languages such as C++ and Python. My focus is on developing 
                    intelligent and scalable solutions by combining my knowledge in Data Science with my expertise in software 
                    engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm working on various projects that challenge my understanding and push the boundaries of my 
                    capabilities, particularly in web development using Django. I believe in continuous learning and am always 
                    seeking new opportunities to grow and contribute to impactful projects.
